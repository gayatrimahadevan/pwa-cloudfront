Arise,awake and donot stop until the goal is reached.
You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can make you spiritual. There is no other teacher but your own soul.
You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.
We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far.
Condemn none: if you can stretch out a helping hand, do so. If you cannot, fold your hands, bless your brothers, and let them go their own way.
All the powers in the universe are already ours. It is we who have put our hands before our eyes and cry that it is dark.
The world is the great gymnasium where we come to make ourselves strong.
External nature is only internal nature writ large.
All differences in this world are of degree, and not of kind, because oneness is the secret of everything.
Truth can be stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true.
